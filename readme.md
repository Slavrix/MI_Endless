# MI_Endless
Endless runner for Mana Interactive


Ensure you have unity installed (you will need your own version)  

Open the Scene `mainScene.unity`.  

Run from there to try it out.  

Currently it is 3d.  

I'll make a 2d branch, or cheat and make this look like 2d (can easily do both)  

Disclaimer:  
Current code in this is scripting rather than proper code.
